# Liver AI Multi-task Model

This repository provides **pre-trained weights** and architecture for a liver pathology scoring model using ResNet50 (grayscale + heightmap input).

Training scripts are not included — weights are provided only for inference and experimentation.



- Predicts 4 liver pathology scores: steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, inflammation
- Generates corresponding heightmaps from uploaded images
- Baseline normalization applied (lowest score set to 0)
- Contrast & brightness enhanced automatically before heightmap generation
- Fully open-source weights (`FinalModel.pth`) which will provided as google drive link upon request. Anyone can refine it further.
